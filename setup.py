long_description = """RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a vital role in the post-transcriptional control of RNAs. They are known to recognize RNA molecules by their nucleotide sequence as well as their three-dimensional structure. ssHMM is an RNA motif finder that combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gibbs sampling to learn the joint sequence and structure binding preferences of RBPs from high-throughput RNA-binding experiments, such as CLIP-Seq. The model can be visualized as an intuitive graph illustrating the interplay between RNA sequence and structure."""
